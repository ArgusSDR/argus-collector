# Argus Collector v0.3.0-beta Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Version**: v0.3.0-beta  
**Focus**: Performance Optimization and User Experience

## üöÄ Major Features

### New Argus Processor Performance Optimizations

This release introduces significant performance improvements to `argus-processor` for TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) analysis:

#### üî• Optimized File I/O (5-10x faster)
- **Memory Mapping**: Large files (>50MB) now use memory mapping for maximum I/O performance
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Automatic selection of optimal I/O method based on file size
  - Small files (<5MB): Standard reading for compatibility
  - Medium files (5-50MB): Optimized buffered I/O with 64KB chunks
  - Large files (>50MB): Memory mapping with direct byte-to-sample conversion
- **Unsafe Operations**: Direct memory access for maximum speed without accuracy loss

#### ‚ö° Multi-Resolution Cross-Correlation (2-5x faster)
- **Three-Stage Search**: Coarse ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Fine resolution correlation
  - **Stage 1**: 8x decimated samples for rapid initial search (~100 correlations)
  - **Stage 2**: 2x decimated samples for refinement (~65 correlations)  
  - **Stage 3**: Full resolution for precision (~17 correlations)
- **Dramatic Speedup**: ~182 total correlations vs 10,001 in single-resolution approach
- **Accuracy Preserved**: Final results identical to single-resolution with much better performance
- **Larger Sample Windows**: Increased from 10k to 50k samples with better performance than old 10k approach

#### üìä Comprehensive Progress Reporting
- **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Real-time progress across all processing stages
- **Smart Updates**: Rate-limited progress updates (2s normal, 500ms verbose)
- **Detailed Information**: Shows current operation, elapsed time, and completion estimates
- **Professional Output**: Clean progress indicators with time estimates

### Enhanced User Experience

#### üé® Clean Output Format
- **Removed Decorative Lines**: Eliminated Unicode box drawings for cleaner terminal output

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Before (v0.2.0):
```bash
# Slow processing with basic output
./argus-processor --input "data/*.dat"
# Limited to 10k samples, single-resolution correlation
# Processing time: ~4-8 minutes for 3 stations
```

### After (v0.3.0):
```bash
# Fast processing with progress reporting
./argus-processor --input "data/*.dat" --verbose
# Multi-resolution correlation, 50k samples
# Processing time: ~1-2 minutes for 3 stations

‚è≥ Step 1/4: Loading and validating data files (elapsed: 2s)
   üìä 66.7% complete (16.7% overall, file 2/3) - 5s elapsed
‚úÖ Step 1/4 complete: Loading and validating data files (25.0% overall, 7s elapsed)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible.

## üìã System Requirements

- Go 1.22.2 or later
- Linux/macOS/Windows (memory mapping optimized for Linux)
- Minimum 4GB RAM for large file processing
- RTL-SDR hardware for signal collection

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The following optimizations are planned for future releases:

1. **FFT-based Cross-Correlation**: 10-100x further speedup potential
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-core correlation analysis  
3. **Advanced Algorithms**: Weighted and Kalman filter approaches
4. **Streaming Processing**: Real-time analysis capabilities

## üêõ Bug Fixes
